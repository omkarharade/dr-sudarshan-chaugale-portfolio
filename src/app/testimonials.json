His ability to detect issues early, combined with the patience and clarity with which he explains every detail to his patients, his friendly nature truly sets him apart. He gives more than 100% efforts — dedicating long hours in the operating room to ensure every surgery is a success. His commitment, confidence and tireless effort truly reflect his passion for patient care. We came all the way from Bangalore to get treatment from sir which is the best decision we have taken."

        "message" : "Hello readers! \nVery recently, I have gone through a umbilical hernia (Abdomen related issue) surgery with Dr. Sudarshan Chaugale. And I felt like sharing my experience with you all of him as a doctor/surgeon and his medical treatment to me as a patient.\nWhen I met him first, I found him listening to my medical problem carefully examining it personally and explaining me the issue in detail and how it can be treated medically by clearing all my medical and personal doubts politely and peacefully.\nHe is a gastroenterologist and along with regular cut surgeries he also does various latest laparoscopic and modern laser abdomen related surgeries too.\nIn my case it was a regular cut surgery. He explained to me the benefits of why I should go for regular style surgery to resolve my problem. It was a great help for me to decide the surgery method and I went ahead with whatever Dr. Sudarshan advised. In post oprative follow up treatment too he was very caring with me which I was happy about and it gave me peace of mind too.\nFriends! What more a patient can expect from his/her doctor now a days?? What ever abdomen related issue one has, I suggest, do meet Dr. Chaugale once and they say na! ' Well begin is half done' and you will feel the same with him for sure.\nI wish Dr. Sudarshan good luck and great success in his field of 'operating'!\n\nWarm regards,\nSandeep Vitekari\nCreative Director-Advt."
